    <h5>Work</h5>
    <p>I am a software developer for Opitz Consulting focusing on mobile apps, modern webclients and IoT
        technologies. I am also a member of the IoT Competence Center researching architectures and technologies for
        the IoT and digital transformation projects. I am a big advocate of open source and therefore share all my
        developments on Github, on conferences and in magazines.</p>
    <h5>Education</h5>
    <p>I studied Information Systems at the University of Cologne. Currently, I'm in my Masters' degree, heading to
        Sydney in Q1 '16. I will specialise further towards data science and complex systems there to improve my skills
        about the IoT.</p>
    <h5>Private</h5>
    <p>Living in Cologne I like going out, cooking, making music, skating, surfing and snowboarding.</p>
    <h5>Travel</h5>
    <p>North America and Europe have been visited but the rest should soon follow!</p>
