author_description: I am a stundent of computer sciences of economics at the University of Cologne. I have been working with software since 2011, where I started to work for OPITZ CONSULTING Deutschland GmbH. There I first learned all about Java and some frameworks, but soon I started to get into mobile and web development and ultimately concerned myself with the Internet of Things. I now spend most of my time with the IoT, mobile and webdev being more of a hobby to keep my skills and maybe improve them a bit. In my private life I enjoy sports such as kitesurfing, wakeboarding, skating, jogging and cycling. I also am a bit of a music enthusiast which is why I enjoy going to quiet a few concerts.
