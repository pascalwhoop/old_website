### Task 1:

* Read the study case Faheem & Muralidhara (2013) on IBMs use of social media applications
* Use the framework by Kane (2015) to analyze how different applications that IBM used affected the company and its employees

### Kanes' Framework

| |Establish Networks|Access Content|
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
|How does platform design constrain user behavior?|1. Consider how platform design affects the way in which people interact|2. Consider how platform design affects the way people share and access content|
|How does platform use affect employee performance?|3. Consider how people will use the platform to network more or less effectively|4. Consider how people will share and protect content more or less effectively|

### developerWorks

**Summary:**

- web-based platform to share technical knowledge worldwide
- avoided any brand association with IBM
- 30k articles, podcasts and tutorials in 11 years
- saved IBM ~ $100 Mio. because people found solutions online instead of contacting IBM support

DeveloperWorks is article-centered. It doesn't put users and their pages in the center but rather centers around the technical content, while the authors are then just represented by a collection of publishments and / or comments. By keeping the website "IBM free", employees as well as customers will communicate more openly concerning their subjective opinions about products and services which can help quality control. All posts are openly available to anyone on the internet, leaving privacy scopes as e.g. on facebook out of the picture. Content however is rather static which makes the platform rather "build up knowledge" instead of representing a constant stream of news. 


### w3 Intranet

**Summary:**

- Corporate intranet portal starting in 1996. ~60k hits / day in 1997 (after 1 year)
- added blogging capabilites in 2003 with RSS, subscribe mechanisms
    - also externally visible if desired
    - with code of conduct publicly available posts by employees also allowing to discuss IBM related topics (with 'own attitude' disclaimer)

Entry point for employees to share knowledge. First centralized information platform usable by any employee within IBM. However, no real social network capabilites are found here.

### Beehive

**Summary:**

- Copycat of facebook/myspace
- trying to mix professional and private content
- 4 years after launch ~ 18% of employees had added a profile

Trying to replicate a IBM internal version of popular private social networks, allowing users to mix both professional and personal content. With an adoption rate of about 18% after 4 years, the adoption was rather low. *In the article it is only stated that 'IBM wanted to see if sharing of photos and personal information, and other Facebook-like tools would promote employee engagement'. There is no mention of the actual success though, implying a unsuccessful or unsatifying result.* 

Commonly, such low adoption rates tend to be highly clustered though, meaning small communities within the larger whole have a much higher adoption rate, while others have a much lower rate. 
In social networks, contacts and communication is much more public compared to email. The concept of information availability (as in public IRC channels) is the passive buildup of a knowledge base that is automatically created by persisting chats and indexing their contents to make them searchable and readable for anyone. Once an information is found, the knowledgable person is not hard to find making social networks and public chats more efficient than emails which are by default private. 

### ThinkPlace

**Summary:**

- idea rating and sharing platform
- collaborate, comment
- shared externally
- allowed to use and reshare ideas (event externals)

ThinkPlace is a great concept to find people having similar ideas to yourself or to follow creative people whose ideas one likes. The network is centered around ideas and creativity. You can probably follow people you find interesting and it supports a basic level of direct (private) communication. *An elaborate fine-grained level of privacy settings to modify who sees what posts and different levels of connection types are not as necessary and therefore probably not implemented.* The platform could also support anonymity for people who might want to first share their ideas anonymously and only take credit once they are deemed as good. 

### BluePages + Fringe

**Summary:**

- With 300k + employees, a sort of phone book to find people based on skills, departments, ...
- due to lack of employees maintaining their profiles, Fringe was added
- Fringe allowed tagging of employees across applications. Blogs, posts, comments, bookmarks, ...

This platform mainly serves as a register and search support to find and index people depending on their skillset, interests and position in the company. Communication is not supposed to be part of the application but it is being integrated into a range of other products to enable feeding data into its databases to improve search results. It definately improves employees performance because it reduces the time needed to find the right conversation partner of a given topic. *While BluePages itself was a rather idealistic approach counting on employees managing their own profile, Fringe added automated data collection algorithms to autonomously build a profile about a persons skillset based on their digital postings, collaboration and participation in various systems and networks.*

### Task 2:

- Use the 3M Framework from Gallaugher & Ransbotham (2010) and apply it to another company that uses social media as a communication tool

There are several ways of communication and observation. Private communication between customers & firms as before, public communications both directed and broadcasted and the most important novelty: Monitoring. Firms can monitor C-C communication, competing firms can monitor the communication of a firm and its customers, other customers can monitor and all can join the conversation if they see a benefit by this.

#### Slack and the 3M Framework

**Slack**

* a messaging app for teams that is on a mission to make your working life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. [Slack Website]
* While no longer using an IRC backend, Slack offers a lot of IRC-Like features: persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, as well as private groups and direct messaging (again, historically based on IRC). All content inside Slack is searchable, including files, conversations, and people. Slack integrates with a large number of third-party services and supports community-built integrations [wikipedia]
* A communication tool aiming to replace or reduce emails, social networks and other communication tools and focuses on the actual core: Transfering information and knowledge between people. It is fully searchable which makes it also a constant knowledge creation engine for deferred inquiries.


**3M Framework for Slack**

* Slack uses Twitter mainly for broadcasting and as a channel for non-slack users or public broadcasting (Megaphone, Magnet, Monitor) communication. 
    - Broadcast new features
    - Broadcast tips for usage
    - Broadcast new integrations and implementation strategies
    - Broadcast user success stories
    - Retweet
    - Broadcast companies who use slack
* They also use in-app based support tickets (Magnet) which then translates into their own customer relationship management teams' Slack. 
    - Quick response time
    - Different types of questions handled by different customer support teams
    - direct contact with engineers if technical Q
* They use tumblr on their own blog allowing 'love' and 'share' features. 
    - Allows monitoring of community
* For technical discussions they rely on stackoverflow and other platforms that are specialised in fostering technical discussions, only monitoring and sometimes intervening to support the community. 
    - Deployed specialists who monitor and intervene when neccessary / beneficial
* Facebook is just used for *Megaphone* + redirect to twitter & help website for questions / *Magnet*
