summary: A summary of the slides for the course ERP during the M.Sc. Information Systems winter semester 2015/16 at the University of Cologne
---

This summary will be written along the lines of the review questions of each slide deck. I will try and answer all questions of the slide decks and by this, summarise each chapter. To differentiate between my already present knowledge and the knowledge I yet have to build up, I'll always try and answer a question by myself first and then research in the slides. My own answers will be written in *italic text*.

## Introduction

### Readings / Papers
* Motiwalla and Thompson (2012), Chapters 1 & 2
* Laudon, Laudon, Schoder (2010)
* Chapter 9 Weske (2012) Chapters 1 & 2

### Questions

#### 1. What are functional silos and how did they evolve in organizations?

*Functional silos are sets of IT systems only available to a limited number of departments or employees in companies. However they are not restricted to these people due to governance or policies but merely due to lack of IT system integration. Other departments would often benefit from the usage of these systems, had they access to them. This also causes data and knowledge to be duplicated and stored multiple times at different locations without any process which keeps these instances in sync.* 

* Silos are basically compartmentalised operating units isolated from their environment.
* They developed through the separation of companies into Planning, Organising, Staffing, Directing, Coordinating, Reporting and Budgeting (a common pattern in the 20th century) and the vertical dimension which was added, separating a company in strategy, tactical and operational layers, causing the company structure to be seen as a matrix.

#### 2. What is the relationship between organizational functional silos and IS functional silos? 

*Over time, IS systems were implemented for numerous departments and company layers. This caused a whole range of IS products and systems to be used in companies. Despite the inital benefits of these systems, organizations started being confronted with bottlenecks due to the lack of integration between those systems.*

#### 3. List the horizontal and vertical levels of systems that exist in organizations.

* Vertical scale: Strategic, Tactic, Operations
* Horizontal scale: Sales, Production, Accounting/Finance, HR

#### 4. Compare and contrast different dimensions of integration. Which do you think is most appropriate for ERP systems and why?

* data, functional, process

Data integration just combines all data pools in a company to make sure no redundant data is present and everybody is working on the same set of information. This could be implemented through a large common database that all applications must use to store and receive data.

Functional integration analyses different functions performed by both systems and people to find common structures and duplications. Reporting tasks e.g. could be found in several departments and can be unified and performed by one cross-functional unit which will then perform these tasks for all departments. This level of integration is the first one that has actual influences on the organizational structure of a company. 

The process integration dimension focuses on the business process at hand. While functional integration doesn't respect the perspective of linked functions interacting with each other or being chained together, the process focuses on cross-functional chains which require both functions and data sets from several parts or departments of the company.   

ERP systems usually make use of data integration as well as a common Business process engine or system which is used to define and track processes across functional domains. The system is also separated into modules which loosely represent the functional silos of a company. 

#### 5. What is logical integration and how is it different from physical integration?

Logical integration concerning the **data dimension** of integration means the synchronisation between several possible storage locations for data. Physical integration means the actual physical storage of all data in the same place. (Schoder, p. 465). Synchronisation doesn't necessarily mean, that all locations need to have the same contents but they all need to be logically structured in the same way to enable applications to communicate data between each other without failure. 


#### 6. What are the key benefits and limitations of systems integration?

*Integrating systems across a business helps companies to streamline their processes towards the customers. Business units are more capable to work together as a team rather than independent units and management is better capable of managing, controlling and improving the overall efficiency of the company. Also, through shared storage and data, companies are less likely to make mistakes due to incoherent data sets of customers or other important information. Therefore the quality of the data which is used as a base for operations is improved.*

*However IS integration also comes with a price which is mainly the high costs to implement and support such integration systems. Also, employees and managers must be trained to adapt to the changed structures to make full use of the systems.*

#### 7. What is the relationship between business processes and systems integration?

*Business processes are a string of actions that usually cross functional borders of a business. In its most complex dimension, system integration uses theses processes to structure both underlying data as well as functions in a business to streamline all business processes towards the customers. This way, a business can quickly adapt to changing markets and provide an optimal experience for the customers.*


#### 8. What are business processes and BPM?

*Business processes are cross-functional or sometimes even cross-business strings of actions, tasks and functions that, put together, create value. BPM is the process of managing said processes by often first formally analysing and describing and later monitor and optimise them.*

#### 9. Describe four types of enterprise applications.

* ERP: Try to be one giant system that includes all sorts of tasks which are common among most businesses independent of their industry. Also, often industry specific functions are included. They span across the organization to coordinate processes and ensure a common data model across the firm. 
* SCM: Supply chain management systems take care of the logistics, resources and operations of production. They are usually used in organizations that produce physical products and can also span across multiple company borders to improve an integrated supply chain. 
* CRM: Manage a companies approach towards customers. It gives a unified overview over all channels, a customer can contact the organization, synchronises the interaction points within the firm (multiple departments), analyses the customers interests, demands, buying habits a.o. to improve sales, customer retention and experience. 
* KM: Knowledge Management systems are used to ensure knowledge is spread across an organization and used wherever useful. 

#### 10. What is the role of ERP systems in system integration?

ERP systems primarily solve the data integration dimension and also serve as a platform for other enterprise systems such as SCM and CRM. They host a process management solution to perform BPM in a uniform manner throughout the company.  

#### 11. What is the role of SCM systems and CRM systems in system integration?

They serve to both streamline the production process towards an optimal process with minimal bufferings and short cycles as well as streamline the customer experience for customers coming into contact with the organization. CRM also analyse the customers behaviour to improves sales and create a better, holistic view of the customer for the firm.

## Business Process Modeling

### Questions

#### 1. What are models in systems development compared to other disciplines?

*Models are a representation of the information system that is to be developed. However these models can describe several perspectives, such as the hardware, software, module, or component perspectives.* 


#### 2. What is a process architecture?

* What processes and their scope
* **Who** is the owner / customer of the process? Suppliers / Partners?
* Supporting processes, managing processes, CORE (the process itself)

![](/images/2016-01-23-erp-master-information-systems-uzk-summary/2.png)

Supporting processes can be used by other processes, while core processes are directly generating value by being linked to external customers

#### 3. List the phases of the business process management lifecycle and how process modelling is involved in them.

0. Process identification 
1. Process discovery → Output: as-is process model
2. Process analysis → Output: insights, strengths, weaknesses
3. Process (re)design → Output: To-be process model
4. Process Implementation → Output: Executable process model
5. Monitoring and controlling → Output: Performance and conformance insights

Process modelling is done during the process design phase, which uses both the as-is model as well as the aquired insights from the analysis and is supposed to output an improved process model. It is also involved in the process discovery phase as well as the implementation phase, because moving from a model concept to an executable version .

#### 4. What are the main components of any business process (model)?

* Activities: active elements, consume time and change state of BOs
* Events: In/Output of process, passive but influence conditional flow of P
* Business Objects (Data): artifacts that undergo state changes, passive, physical or electronic
* Actors (or Resources): Humans and systems, that perform operations

#### 5. What are the key elements of BPMN?

* **Flow Objects**: Events, activities and gateways
* **Artefacts:** Data objects, groups and annotations
* **Connecting objects**: sequence & message flow, associations
* **structuring**: swimlanes

#### 6. What is the relationship between business processes, business process models, and enterprise applications?

* Business processes are the in-fact activities that are taking place in organizations, independent on wether they are modelled or not. The models then are a formal representation of these processes and are used to both analyse and improve or change the ongoing processes. Enterprise applications then present a platform to execute and analyse these processes.

## Chapter 3: Business Process Management

### Questions 

#### 1. What is business process management?

Business process management is the definition, analysis, implementation and improvement of ongoing processes in an organization. A business process is usually a string of activities that are directly linked to value generation. Most of the time this means theses processes are tightly connected to what customers require. 

![](/images/2016-01-23-erp-master-information-systems-uzk-summary/3.png)

#### 2. What are key measures for process performance, and how are they related to each other?

* **R**: average flow rate: Number of flow units that flow through the process per time unit. *unit / time*
* **I**: Average Inventory: Average number of flow units present within the process boundaries
* **T**: Average Flow Time: The average time, a unit takes to finish the process.

\`I = R * T\` also called **Little's Law**

#### 3. How is flow time analysed and assessed?

Flow time can be influenced by two factors. The total time spent processing the unit (**operations**) and the total time waiting (**buffers**). While operations are necessary and can only be shortened, if the operations become more efficient, the buffers are an unwanted necessity to make the process work and should be kept minimal. The ratio between time being processed and T(waiting+processing) is called the **Flow Time Efficiency**. The sum of all processing durations is also called **Theoretical Flow Time** and describes the time needed if no waiting was necessary. If several paths are possible, the one with the highest theoretical flow time is called **critical path**. Waiting here causes direct delays to the overall process.

It is also possible to separate a process into value-adding and non-value-adding activities. Value adding activities are those, that directly increase the economic value of a flow unit while the NVAAs, while required, do not directly add value. The lower the ratio NVAA/activities, the higher the **process quality**.

**To measure**:

* Direct: the flow time, take a sample of n units and measure entry to exit time, make average.
* Indirect: Measure number of units produced in given period of time. Compute R. Take n measures of I during period, compute T using *Little's Law*

**To Calculate**:
Theoretical flow time + average waiting = T

#### 4. How is flow rate analysed and assessed?

The flow rate describes the amount of units that the process can output at a given time interval / unit. 

* The **Process capacity** is the maximum sustainable flow rate of a process. 
* The **Theoretical capacity** is the maximum sustainable flow rate if the **bottleneck resource** is fully utilized. 
	* TC(p) = TC(bottleneckResource)
* Activities are performed by **resources**. A **resource pool** is a collection of interchangeable resources that can perform identical tasks. Each is called a *resource unit*.
* **T<sub>p</sub>[time]**: The **unit load of a resource unit** is the total amount of time a resource works on a flow unit. A resource unit can be used in several activities therefore its load is the sum of all activities in which is is utilised
* **Load batch (LB)**: Number of units that a resource can process simultaneously. 
	* Theoretical capacity for parallel working resource: LB<sub>unit</sub> / T<sub>p</sub>
		* only applicable if parallel work doesn't cause efficiency drops on the unit level
* **Scheduled availability (SAV)**: Amount of time a resource is planned to operate

 
$$TC(unit) = \frac{1}{T_{p,scheduled}}* LB_{unit}*SAV$$

then the TC of a resource pool is

$$ TC(unit) * poolsize $$


**To measure**: Count the units processed over an extended period of time. Compute the flow units per unit of time.


#### 5. What is capacity utilisation and how it is assessed?

It measures the utilisation of resources that are available relative to their actual utilisation

\`ρ_p=\frac{\text{Throughput}}{\text{theoretical capacity of resource pool p}}\`

the CU of the process is again the one of the bottleneck resource pool

#### 6. How can processes be improved and what is the role of information technology in this?

**To improve**: 

* Abstract
	* Eliminate activities
	* Work in parallel
	* increase efficiency
* formula / model based
	* reduce: flowtime, inventory, cost
	* increase: throughput rate, quality

**Role of IT**

IT can help in several ways. It can help transfer data instantaneous instead of physically transferring it, causing a reduction in NVAA activity time → increased process quality. It can also enable coordination of actors to allow concurrency and therefore reducing the length of the critical path. Also it can help eliminate activities like controlling and validation steps by automated quality controls.

To improve an overall process, the bottlenecks capacity need to be improved. A good process is one that has a good performance which means a good relative financial measure. E.g. ROI

### Other notes

It is a common pattern to either improve a process through making it more *cost-effective* or by making it more *responsive*. 

Over time, the reasons for competitive advantage have changed. Before the 60s, economies of scale were the primary source of competitive advantage. Mass production without customising were.

Business Processes are positioned on multiple layers of an organization. However the executable processes (mostly modelled using BPMN) are commonly found in the operational layer, not the organizational layer. Here, value chain diagrams only describe the abstract concepts due to lack of instrumentalisation. 


![](/images/2016-01-23-erp-master-information-systems-uzk-summary/4.png){:.img-400 .center}

#### Dumas (2013) 6 steps of BPM engagement

1. Identification
2. Discovery (as-is)
3. Analysis
4. (Re)-Design
5. Implementation
6. Monitor/Control

Dumas separates the process environment of organizations into three levels. 1. Process Landscape (strategic), 2. Abstract Process Models (tactic) and Detailed Process Models (BPMN, operational

IT is being used to improve steps 5 & 6 by virtually representing the process and then using adequate measures to identify bottlenecks, and improve the process.

#### Walmart example

Strategy: Walmart wants to give quality products at competitive prices.

Operations strategy goals: Reduce flow times (T) and inventory levels (I)

Results: Inventory turned over twice a week (average every 2 weeks), improved sales per square foot

## Enterprise Application Integration

### Readings / Papers

* Motiwalla and Thompson (2012), Chapters 3 & 4 
* Weske (2012), Chapter 2 
* Tanenbaum and Van Steen (2007), Chapters 1‐4

### Questions

#### 1. What is enterprise application integration?

*EAI is the process of making several individual applications and systems in an organization work together. This can be done in several ways, the most common pattern being integrating 3-tier architectures through one of the three layers.*

EAI focuses on the **technical dimension** not on the business reasoning behind the decision (as in BPM)

##### 1.1 Why use EAI?

* Supporting large enterprises especially useful after M&As
* Reuse investments in existing systems 
	* beware sunk-cost fallacy

#### 2. What is component‐oriented development?

*A concept which breaks a desired system down into several separate components which can be individually developed. Each component defines its communication approach with other components and publishes this. These are called **interfaces** and are the basis of communication between components. Often there are interface **best practices** or **standards** which cause a homogenous interface structure among components.*

A **component** includes a set of *interfaces*, *requirements to the environment* and its *executable code*.

##### 2.1 Whats the difference between Components and Objects?

components can be implemented using objects or any other concept. Objects are a programming structure paradigm while components are architectural level entities.
 
##### 2.2 What are component frameworks and component models?

A component framework is a wrapping environment for components. It defines a common structure all components must have and then helps to use the components in this environment. A component model are rules, standards and conventions used by the component developer to ensure a common structure where possible. 

##### 2.3 What is the difference between interfaces & messages?

**Interfaces** allow runtime and compilation time type checking. Are usually used for intra-program and intra-server communication.
   
**Messages** are used for inter-system communication. They have no type-checking and are, compared to interfaces, quiet slow (due to communication overhead, queuing etc)

#### 3. What are parts of a distributed architecture?

**Interfaces**: Define the IN and OUTput of a component. An interface has access points and describes how to interact with these points. It also describes what is returned depending on the data passed to the access points. It serves as a **contract**. This also enables the replacement of the **implementation** without changing the contract or interface. On the other hand it allows to add more functionality be extending the interface and writing new implementation modules without touching the already created ones. 

* Interfaces don't include metadata such as latency, security, quality of implementation. Only describes a way of calling it and what is returned. 

**Late Binding**: Embed the location of the resource in the code reduces flexibility. Instead a name-address concept is used to allow runtime-dependent resolution. Similar to URL-IP-DNS, this allows load-balancing, moving, replacement, ...

**Location Service**: Resolves the Name-Address Link

**Protocol**: A *language*, both systems agree on to communicate the data. Usually there is a single base protocol that all systems support (within the *system landscapes* boundaries)

#### 4. What different topologies and types of integration architectures exist?

Topologies: 

* Hub-spoke
* Bus
* Point to point

Layers: 

* Data
* Model
* View

##### 4.1 What are pro's and cons for each topology?

**Point2Point**: Is very easy and fast to implement and usually the best approach for small scenarios and systems. However, it causes a very tight coupling among the components with many interfaces (each component defines 1-n for 1-n components around it). Also once it grows too large, its unbearbale to manage. 

**Bus**: Very scalable, one interface per system. However there's a big overhead for coordination the Bus is equivalent to a single point of failure (can be solved with a redundant active-passive backup). 

**Hub-Spoke**: Few interfaces (same as Bus), extension is very easy, but again single point of failure & hub → potential bottleneck

##### 4.2 What is the difference between a Hub and a Bus?

>The key difference between hub/spoke and bus topology is that for the bus architecture, the integration engine that performs message transformation and routing is distributed to the application adapters rather than centralizing it to a single 'hub'.

Hub/Spoke: The Hub is the single centralized broker system which takes care of the transformation and routing. This affects scalability.

Bus: the load of data transformation and routing is carried out by the 'adapters' at each spoke systems' entry into the bus.  Here the bus is more of a messaging conduit serving the spoke systems without having the pressure of middleware tasks (data transform & routing).

#### 5. What are components of an EAI framework?

![](/images/2016-01-23-erp-master-information-systems-uzk-summary/5.png)

**Adapters:** allow communication with specific applications. 

**Middleware / Message Mgmt**: Briding differences between applications, performing transactions, distribution of messages, transformations.
 
 **Process Management:** Basically BPM layer
 
 **Meta Database and additional services**: Administration of central data and configurations, identity, monitoring

##### 5.1 What are differentiation characteristics of the middleware component in an EAI framework?

* Synchronous or asynchronous communication
* function- object- or service oriented.

#### 6. What is message‐oriented middleware?

* Asynchronous communication
* Implementation of queuing systems to assure message delivery
* load distribution
* independent of system or implementation, as long as system speaks protocoll.
* Can simulate synchronous communication although asynchronous

##### 6.2 What roles can a MOM take?

* It can hide the receiver from the sender (sender only knows name but not address)
* It can perform delivery assurances
* It can perform transaction handling

##### 6.2 Drawbacks of MOM?

* Single point of failure → needs high-availability tech behind it
* Can be bottleneck
* Testing is difficult
    * can be OK with API Management + automated stub/mock-based testing
 
#### 7 What is SOA? What are the 5 components of a service specification?

A Software development model based on a contract between consumer (client) and provider (server). It is more a concept rather than a technology and also often considered a buzzword  


specifies the following 5 components:
 
 * Functional description of the service
 * Input requirements and output specifications
 * Precondition environment state
 * Postcondition environment state
 * Error handling in case of breakdown
 
##### 7.1 What are the three core components of a SOA according to Weske?

* Service provider
* Service requester
* Service registry

##### 7.2 Name a few benefits of a SOA environment

* Location independent of business logic
* reuse of logic and services easily
* Service can exist anywhere (message based communication over internet protocols)
* Runtime search and usage of services possible

##### 7.3 Name some drawbacks of a SOA environment

* Performance can be sketchy
* High cost to implement, very complex base-setup
* Security specialists often required to ensure security

#### 8. How do different architectures differ from each other, and what is their relationship to each other?

Architectures

#### 9. What are recent trends in EAI?

* Webservices using REST Endpoints and API Management
* Single-Sign-On services using identity providers such as Facebook or Google
* Cloud based hosting and SaaS, instead of big license packages
    * Scenarios include: Load-Peaks, Flexible fast scaling growth, temporary ressources
    * Risk of data security, lock-in effects, disucussion about interlectual property rights
* BI, BigData, Internet of Things, Digitalization
* 
       
##### 9.1 What are a few benefits of Cloud computing?

* Flexible growth
* Only pay what you need (no fixed costs)
* focus on business value of application
* global availability

## ERP Systems

### Readings / Papers

* Motiwalla and Thompson (2012), Chapters 1-7

### Questions

#### 1. What is necessary for the ERP implementation to be successful?

*An ERP implementation affects the entire organization. Therefore Top Management must actively support the project and help communicate key facts about changes and challenges. Besides the technical perspective of 'how you implement an ERP system' the organization must also make sure all involved management commits to the changes and all personel gets adequate support and training with the new systems. The systems should be implemented together with the users to ensure optimal user acceptance which is key to allowing a stage-by-stage type of transition phase to be successful.*

#### 2. What is ERP system architecture?

* As with all IS architectures, a description of the **logical modules**, their interfaces, functionality (what, not how), their requirements and what modules they depend on
* The **hardware components** required to enable the system to work.

#### 3. Why is it important to have good enterprise system architecture?

To handle complexity, especially with large enterprises, enable expansion or even M&A. Modularization is the key to handling complexity and ongoing changes to the systems landscape. 

#### 4. What is the role of architecture in ERP implementation?

Enable the support of a diverse set of hardware and software platforms and decrease complexity for developing departments and vendors. 

#### 5. List five of the major functional modules of ERP.

* SCM (Often Production, Purchasing, Inventory Management)
* Finance
* HR
* CRM


#### 6. Discuss the different types of ERP architectures.

* 3 Tier / [Web Services] architecture
    * Model (Data Tier)
    * Controller (Business Logic Tier)
    * [API / Delivery Tier] → sometimes needed to support diverse client types *4th tier*
    * View (Presentation)

Older versions are the monolithic approach or client-server architectures.


#### 7. List benefits and limitations of one ERP architecture.

The 4-tier architecture offers increased flexibility to support diverse types of devices. This approach is also often called API-first, because the core enablement for supporting new devices lies in the reuse and extension of the published API endpoints. While most 3tier architectures tried to support several PCs and maybe different browser types, the 4 tier architecture tries to support all sorts of devices, independent of screen size & existence and human involvement.

#### 8. What is service-oriented architecture and how is it different from Web services architecture?

SOA is an architectural concept describing the combination of different service providers to create composite functions and applications. A typical SOA architecture usually also has a register which all service providers use to publish their services and consumers use to find the providers they require to solve their problems. Web services are actual technical implementations. Web services can be service providers in a SOA. SOA is a concept, webservices are a more concrete implementation concept. 

#### 9. What are the key benefits and limitations of systems integration?

**Duplicate**

#### 10. What is the role of management in designing enterprise systems integration?

Filter hyped technologies from useful ones. The architecture doesn't only influence the IT side of a business but also the organisation structure and the employees.

#### 12. Briefly discuss the key phases of the SDLC methodology.

Classic: Analysis, Planning, Implementation, Testing, Rollout

This approach (also called waterfall model) includes first analysing the system environment, the requirements, the technology at hand, ... . Aftwards a system structure is designed, with descriptions for modules, their tasks and how they solve their problems. These modules are then implemented and tested. Once all modules work together as they're supposed to, the system is rolled out. This can also be a closed loop in which the rollout is followed by a continous maintenance, reanalyse, redesign, ... process. 

#### 13. Discuss the alternate approaches of SDLC and the benefits of these alternatives.

An alternative is **rapid prototyping**. Here a very primitive prototyp is developed to explore technical possibilities, development velocity of the teams who are responsible for the development and discover possible problems and limitations. The system is quickly demonstrated to the users who give feedback. This is reincorporated and presented again. In the end the prototype can either be discarded or reused to be developed into the later full blown system. 

**End User Development**: End users are trained to be able to part take or completely develop the system by themselves. While the later option is rather unrealistic, the former makes sense, since a few of the users become part of the development team and lead the team towards the actual user requirements to ensure the appropriateness of the developments. 

**Agile Development**: Small Teams, rapid feedback, iterative, always adding more functionality, finding requirements "on the fly"


#### 14. Compare and contrast the three major ERP implementation categories.

* **Comprehensive**: Adapt system processes heavily to fit actual processes present in the company. Causes high implementation costs. "*Make the system fit the company*"

* **Middle-of-the-road**: Change some pre-defined processes to fit the ones which the organisations believes gives them a competitive advantage. Adopt other best-practices, which seem more rational to adopt rather than reimplement. *Most common middle-ground*

* **Vanilla**: Completely change the business structure to fit all the best practices provided by the ERP system. *This can cause the organization to become a default type business with little room for being above average. However this leads to a structure that can easily be merged into larger companies making the organization attractive for M&As.*

#### 15. What is ERP implementation methodology? Give examples. 

The differentiation is made again between **traditional** (similar to waterfall) and **rapid** (similar to agile) life cycles. Traditional life cycles require step-by-step sequential development, involving milestones and formal reviews. The rapid life-cycle empowers teams and employees to make decisions themselves to keep progress velocity up. 

#### 16. List the major tasks in the scope and commitment phase of the ERP life cycle.

* Gap Analysis: Whats missing and needs to be implemented?
* Physical Scope: What sites (locations of company) will be addressed? How many users?
* BPM Scope: Will processes be changed? Who's affected?
* Technical Scope: How much modification will be done to the ERP system?
* Resource Scope: How high are the costs for redevelopment and the overall project?
* Implementation Scope: The How of the technical scope. 

#### 17. List the major tasks in the analysis and design phase of the ERP life cycle.

* Decide on experts & consultants
* analyse detailed user requirements
* map differences current-planned (detailed for each process)
* Design a change management plan
* Data & system conversion
* Training

*I am unsure about the training and the data/system conversion. While the former sounds like something done parallel to the implementation phase (preparing the users), the latter actually belongs to the implementation phase.*


#### 18. List the major tasks in the acquisition and development phase of the ERP life cycle.

Install and release systems. Conversion can be done by one of the four phases:

* Phased
* Pilot
* Parallel
* Big Bang

#### 19. What is the role of change management in the ERP life cycle?

Communicate all important information to involved people. Inform users about reasons and provide training. 

#### 20. List the major differences between the ERP life cycle and SDLC.

**What the slides claim:** the ERPLC is considered equivalent to the more abstract situation of buy before make. So the four dimensions *goals, analysis, design and implementation* are aligned with purchasing and modifying software products. 

#### 21. What are the components of an ERP system?

* Database server(s)
* Application server(s)
* Web server(s)
* Firewalls
* Clients

All critical components must be failsafe and therefore redundant.

#### 22. Why would a company choose to implement an ERP?

*To integrate all data and knowledge throughout an organization into one centralised knowledge and data state. Although the matrix structure of companies helps break complex tasks down into manageable subtasks, it caused many companies departments to limit their scope of horizon to their departments borders without keeping the whole companies goal in mind. This led to isolated knowledges isles, duplicate data stores, inefficient information sharing and coordination. ERP systems counter this trend by integrating all departments data into **one central database**. An ERP system also coordinates all of an organizations **functions** focusing on the companies overall end-to-end **processes***

#### 23. What are third-party products and why are they needed?

*Third-party products are components, applications or systems that are offered by vendors to purchase, license or rent by organizations to solve certain tasks. Typical examples are office software, company chats, forums, wikis, email servers, building entrance authorisation system, ... They aren't necessarily needed but often it's just smarter to purchase such systems from specialist vendors rather than redeveloping them yourself (reinvent the wheel...)*

#### 24. What are the pros and cons of implementing a system without customisation?

*Without any customisation, a system might be quickly implemented and the project risk is much lower, however, either the entire business has to adapt to the systems default process structures or a mismatch between the actual processes and the implemented ones will exist. Also without customisation, a company might loose its competitive edge over other companies.* 

#### 25. Why are there differences between a transactional and reporting database?

A reporting database is not required to supply 100% accurate transaction safety. It can therefore be designed to be most efficient in serving reads with complex queries and interdependencies between data segments. A transactional DB on the other hand must ensure transaction safety, data consistency and each transaction must be checked against possible meta rules. 

It could therefore be rational to perform a batch copy of the transactional DB once a day (only the 𝝙) and restructure this data in a way so that is can be queried in an efficient manner. 

#### 26. What are the steps in purchasing an ERP?

1. Vendor research to *see whats possible*
2. Define requirements
3. request information from vendors
4. Match & prefilter
5. Request for bids
6. Detailed Analysis
    * Technical: complexity, compatibility, future-proofness → costs
    * business: cost of ownership, benefits
7. contract negotiations

#### 27. Who generally needs to be involved in the ERP selection process and why?

* Quality Manager: To ensure both sides abide to the contract 
* Program Manager: Will later lead the transition to ERP
* Management: Be part of negotiations and demonstrations, decision makers, must back the project.

#### 28. What is total cost of ownership (TCO) and why should it be a part of the ERP selection process?

TCO is an estimate for the total costs arising when an organization decides to purchase or in-house develop a product. The TCO includes amongst the license and hardware costs also the training, introduction, insurance, audit, testing, ... costs. It tries to include all costs, direct and indirect, caused going forward with the one or the other alternative.

#### 29. What are the key components in the contract negotiation and licensing?

* Product to purchase and maintenance / long term support terms
* Services for implementation phase
* Deliverables + Dates
* Customer **must** have *acceptance authority*

#### 30. Why is it important in the request for bid process to make the vendors reply in a specified format?

To allow objective comparisons between vendors and simplify the comparison process afterwards. This should, if possible, be done using a predefined evaluation model to minimize biased results. 

#### 31. Why is communication important in this phase?

Keeps everyone involved, informs the entire staff about ongoing negotiations. Most staff isn't involved yet but will feel included. 
*Also informing staff about offers by vendors allows for feedback from specialists in certain areas. If vendors supply misleading, marketing-biased information, specialists will be able to uncover such issues.* 

#### 32. What is the difference between RFI and RFB?

[[from wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_information)

A request for information (RFI) is a standard business process whose purpose is to collect written information about the capabilities of various suppliers. Normally it follows a format that can be used for comparative purposes.

*A RFB is a request from the purchasee to the vendor to make an offer concerning both cost and products and/or service supplied.*

#### 33. What are the benefits of a bidding process to purchase an ERP? 

Significant savings are possible through negotiations and specifications of required modules to ensure that only those modules which are required are purchased and licensed. Also if inclusion of office, technology and legal team is done right, market standards become transparent and adequate expectations towards vendors are developed.

#### 34. Why is the readiness process so important to an ERP implementation?

The readiness process synchronises the distributed teams state to ensure the overall project meets the deadline. All subteams are fairly separated from each other due to the components based project setup. Although the PMO coordinates all teams, a **detailed check of what is done and what is missing** helps to restructure the ressource pool (mainly developers and specialists) towards critical open issues. 

#### 35. What project areas need to be assessed in a readiness process?

* testing, infrastructure, services, support, training, development of custom modules, customisation

#### 36. What is included (and not included) during the stabilisation timeframe?

The stabilisation timeframe occurs after all data migration is complete, all training has been completed and staff starts using the new system in a productive environment. Although training was received, inefficiences due to new, uncommon products are to be expected and subject specialists should be available to assist users with the new systems. IT staff closly monitors the infrastructure to evaluate possible bottlenecks and find optimal instrumentalisation for automated monitoring.

#### 37. Why is the knowledge transfer important to the long-term stability of the ERP system?

Most specialists involved during the implementation of the system are usually from outside consulting companies or the vendor itself. To minimise costly support cases with the vendor, a high level of expertise about the new system should also be developed within the company. All knowledge should be collected in one central, openly available, repository (like a wiki or some other knowledge management platform)

#### 38. What are the five areas addressed in <del>postproduction</del> post-implementation / production support?   

In the slides there are 6..

* Training
* Go-Live Support
* Data Validation / Correction (2)
* Patching Fixing
* Implementation of new Features

#### 39. What is the role of a project manager and program manager?

A **project manager** has a single team to manage and is responsible for a specific project. 

A **program manager** coordinates multiple projects to ensure achievement of the business goals. The program manager could possibly be a synonym for the **project executive**

![](/images/2016-01-23-erp-master-information-systems-uzk-summary/6.png){: .center .img-400}

#### 40. What are the skills, knowledge, and abilities required to be a project manager?

A project manager needs to have sufficient technical skills to lead his/her team concerning the tasks they have to complete. Also above-average social skills are required as are for any role where a person has to not only be part of team but lead a team.

*TBH this is a very open questions and can be answered in 2-200 lines*

#### 41. Name five critical success factors and why they are important to the success of a project.

> *These 5 points are taken from the slides with comments by me. These should be taken with a grain of salt since I'm a bit of a realist*

* **Decision Making Process**: Slides call for a predefined process. It can however be discussed that a rigid process is worse than intuitive working but well proven leaders.
* **Project Scope**: A fixed scope describing the goal of the project to ensure the overall work doesn't constantly have to change direction. While small teams may work agile, discovering ultimate requirements as they go, the overall project goal should be obvious and clearly defined from the beginning. 
* **Teamwork**: Focus especially on working with externals. Soft-Skills...
* **Change Management**: Do a little propaganda for the project, making everybody be on-board with it to ensure everybody works helps out instead of working against the goal. 
* **Implementation and Executive Team**: Executive Management support.. But then any project is more likely to be successful if Top Management endorses the plans. And a good implementation team is always better than a bad one..

#### 42. What role can the company executives play in an implementation?

Constantly communicate how important the project is, ensure sufficient funds and manpower to enable the project managers to set up efficient teams. Enable the PMO to work effectively by providing proactive assistance instead of being passive.

#### 43. What is “scope creep” and why is it important to manage during an ERP implementation? 

Scope creep is a common situation of changing goals which aren't properly documented. To counter scope creep, a proper process should be set up to correctly evaluate, document and communicate changes in scope.

## Customer Relationship Management Systems

*This chapter had no questions, so a classical summary will be created. However since we also want to create Anki flashcards out of this, I will still create questions/flashcard templates using the h4 and h5 level headings.*

### Readings / Papers

Motiwalla and Thompson (2012), Chapter 12

### Customer Relationship Management

#### What is CRM?

A system that incorporates **corporate strategy**, business methodology and technology to achieve a myriad of goals in a customer-driven environment. Ultimately the systems abstract goal is to increase profits and customer satisfaction. It does this through helping to understand customers better (**backend analysis** as well as **front-end customer facing support** like managing channels, interaction frequency, tracking issues, coordinating communication, ...).

#### Give a brief history of CRM

CRM started as a tool to automatically manage customer interaction processes. The markets environment changed and so did marketing go from mass marketing in the beginning to segmented marketing to individualized marketing. Now both large and small businesses must deliver **high quality products** that also offer **unique individualized experiences**.

### Customer Relationship Management Systems 

#### Name the different types of CRM

* Data Warehouse (Analytical CRM)
* Customer Loyalty Management (Operational CRM)
* Communicative CRM (Multi Channel Mgmt)
* Collaborative CRM (Multi Point Mgmt) [Different departments -- Customer]

#### What's the difference between CRM and CRM systems?

CRM is a process of continously improving interactions with the customer and finding opportunities to improve sales. The CRM systems are a cross-functional set of applications that work together to technically enable these goals. 

#### What do CRM analysis processes do?

To ensure optimal allocation of ressources, a company should focus its efforts on the customers who are most likely to generate revenue in the future. To enable this

* **Understand the customer** and his patterns, wishes and needs to decide on the **probability** that he is **likely to purchase a product or service**.
* sort the customers based on some form of (multidimensional) ranking and focus efforts on the *best* ones

Also analyze feedback from customers to incorporate this into future products or individualize the customers experience to better fit the desired state.

#### What are a few technologies used in CRM? (maybe buzzword bingo)

* Data Mining
* Business Intelligence
* Big Data

#### What is SFA?

*Sales Force Automation*

Functionality for sales personnel to automate sales lead distribution and tracking

#### On-Demand CRM

* Hosted CRM systems that are accesible via the browser and offer pay-as-much-as-you-use pricing models
* Especially attractive for small businesses who require sophisticated CRM but whose primary field isn't IT.

#### Describe the CRM Life-Cycle

The life-cycle goes beyond technology and also focuses on people, business and business philosophy. 

#### What are the three core customer focused data blocks of CRM?

* Sales
* Service
* Marketing
* [maybe also complaints but they can go into service]

### Benefits, Drawbacks, and Trends

#### Who is the most valuable customer?


3 Dimensions are used to predict future probability to cause revenue:

* Recentness (of last purchase)
* Frequency (of purchases)
* Monetary value (of each purchase)

*Also there are special factors that can influence the value of a customer like current location, age, employment state, ... . It's of no value to a German service provider to spend a lot of money on individual marketing for a person that just moved abroad.*

#### What is the (hypothetical) business value of CRM?

Clear knowledge about customers which leads to: More cost-effective marketing, higher retention rates.

#### Drawbacks and risks of CRM?

There is no *guaranteed succuess of effectiveness* of CRM. It's really hard to determine causality (*although corellation should be existing*)

<del>Difficult and expensive to implement.</del>
*Not really applicable anymore with SaaS providers*

#### What are a few examples of modern analytical CRM?

* **Taste profiling**: Tracking purchases (and *looks*) to remember your taste

* **Persuasion profiling**: Trying to understand what will persuade you to buy something by Trial & Error. A continously changing model of a customer can be built to improve what products will be displayed.

## Questions for Prof. Rosenkranz

1. Why is the Wonder Shed Inc example concluding I<sub>w</sub>/R = T<sub>w</sub> ? If 16,5 units/h are produced and a total of 80 are in the process (+ 5 in each stage?) then shouldn't 80/ 0,275 = T and ≠ T<sub>w</sub>?
2. Why is it called _postproduction support_? That suggests support AFTER the product was used in production which is after 10 or so years? see [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_support)
3. Why is the question 38 Chapter 5 saying "the 5 areas" when ths slides specify 6? Also this suggests hard-coded memorizing rather than learning by understanding...
4. Chapter 5, 101: Why do ERP systems not require hardware? Why is integration, adaptation and customization (that goes beyond tweaking some parameters) not included in the "Implementation" phase?
5. Chapter 2, Q 1: What are models in systems development compared to other disciplines?.. Why should academics in the field of systems development redefine the *model* term?
6. Chapter 1 Q10 & 11. What is the role of ERP, SCM and CRM in systems integration? *Well what is the role? I can see ERP being required as a platform and common data model. But what about CRM? Does it have a role in sys integration?*
7. Chapter 6 Slide 21: A lead is potential customer isn't it? So it would be lead → actual customer
