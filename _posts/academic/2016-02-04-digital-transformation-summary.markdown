## Lecture Unit 12: Social Media and social Network Analysis

**How can organizations take advantage from enterprise social media and networks?**

* Social media has grown strongly in the last years in the private environment
* Goal to adapt to corporate environments to reap the benefits
    - Enrich customer interaction
    - digitalize information and communication (tacit to explicit knowledge)
* many **decision points**
    - laws, cultural structure, previous ways of communication


   
#### Prediction markets in the context of social media?

Concept of stock markets transferred to ideas. Many people vote for ideas based on their expected performance. Every person has a predefined amount of currency that can be used to vote for different ideas. Ideas are then comparable based on their (virtual) value.


*Question by me for the professor: Could the UzK enable a project to create a learning platform that works university wide and allows students and teachers to work hand in hand on both elementary materials, practice guides, lectures, flash cards, research, etc. Social Coding concepts from Github could be used. Also social networking plattforms like Gitter and Slack.*

*Can be combined with a new payment model that uses the amount of supplied participation by different users as an indicator for contribution and also the amount of usage as an indicator of received benefits. The concept is easier explained with a communication tool like slack, where each user only pays depending on how much he benefited from the system (e.g. using amount of messages sent/received, length, online time, productivity as measuring instruments for overall benefit). Similarly, the platform could bill a student based on the amount of benefits he received and substract these costs with contributed content. If a student contributes a lot of valuable content, he becomes a cash-flow recipient, if he only benefits from existing content, he pays more. If he uses the system much and learns a lot, he pays more, if he doesn't learn a lot (and therefore usually has worse grades), he pays less.*


#### Implications of Corporate Blogging (Example Daimler)

Positive: Many visitors, high retention, high inclusion of internal employees
