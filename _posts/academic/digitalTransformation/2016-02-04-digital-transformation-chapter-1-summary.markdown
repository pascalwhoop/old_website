DT is the use of new digital technologies to enable major business improvements. It radically improves performance or reach of enterprises. For this it uses, social media, mobile technologies, embedded technologies, analytics and other trends in IT.

* The use of social media has also led to an increase of **digital communties**. Many such communities exist and their reach and power is increasing quickly. They rely on collaboration, trust and turn consumers into *prosumers* filling both roles of a consumer and a producer. Many business models surrounding this concept are emerging
* **Embedded devices** are all types of devices which are being connected and interconnected. Since the communication technology constantly improves and therefore communication becomes cheaper and easier. Also according to **Metcalfe's Law**, a networks usefulness equals the square of the number of users, meaning networked devices are more useful than independent ones. 
* **Mobility** leads to the restructuring of how users interact with applications. Services are available over the internet with firewalls separating the business' servers from the public world and systems are able to serve more and more types of devices.
* **BigData and BI** help analysing huge amounts of data which are now all stored digitally instead of physially as was a common practice in the last century.
