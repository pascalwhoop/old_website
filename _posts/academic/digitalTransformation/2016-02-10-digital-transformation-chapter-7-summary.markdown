There are general problems with IT which give reason for IT controlling:

##### Portfolio Controlling by Krcmar

* **Coordinate** IT/IS **projects** within organization and lead them towards a **unified decision making process**
* Ensure **strategic relevance and economic efficiency**
* Prioritize

##### Project Controlling by Krcmar

* Deals with the development and introduction of IS/IT with regard to economic efficiency and effectiveness aspects
* Monitoring of economic efficiency, quality, functionality, and deadlines of individual actions
* Developing an experience database

##### Product Controlling by Krcmar

* Inspection of finished products
* Ensure quality & effective use of operational systems


## Selected methods of IT Controlling

### Concept and methods of cost accounting 

##### TCO

Total Cost of Ownership: **About 45% directly visible, rest "invisisble" costs**

* Acquisition Costs
* Operatoins Costs
* Control Costs

##### Internal IT Cost and Service Allocation

Use of IT needs to be spead across departments or products to ensure fair spread among parts of organization. Same principles as in accounting apply with costs being applied to **cost centres** (departments) and **cost objects** (products)


##### IT Chargeback / Showback

* Internal IT provides IT services
* Usage of internal prices, departments can purchase services and products from internal IT
* Encourage cost awareness for IT


### Traditional(financial) accounting policies

#### NPV

Net Present Value

i = opportunity risk of capital
t = time of cashflow (e.g. in years)
Z = the net cash flow

##### Aspects of NPV calculations

* Investment level: How much has to be invested?
* Operating life: How long does the investment have an effect? 
* Net present value: How profitable will the investment be?
* Rate of return: How much interest can be earned with the investment?

#### ROI

return of investment

gain-cost / cost

Usually a number around but slightly above 0%. Very simple key index to assess wether an investment pays off. 

##### ROI critique

* Dimensions of time is unclear
* capital costs (WACC) left out
* absolute height of invest is irrelevant
* risks are not taken into account

#### EVA

Economic value added

Only profits that exceed capital costs are profits recognized in the sheet

##### EVA Formula

EVA = NOPAT - (NOA * WACC)

### Performance-based methods

Specific indicators to use to identify causes for costs and revenues or quality losses / gains

* Efficiency
* Degree of IT Innovation
* Process quality
* Ressource utilization

#### Examples for Ratios for performance-based evaluation

* IT spending per employee
* Revenue per IT Dollar
* Planed spending vs actual spending

#### Strategic System of indicators

IT balanced scorecard

### Qualitative and multi-criteria methods

Investments cannot be quantified by monetary values. Multicriteria methods are required. 

* Portfolio method
* Scoring Model
* SLAs

#### Portfolio Method for IT controlling

* borrowed from finance portfolio method
* all projects evaluated on multiple dimensions (risk, use, ROI, etc)
* result in a matrix which can be used to prioritize ressources
