summary: This unit reflects on how firms can manage their information systems and resources in a manner than supports the strategic goals. Several frameworks are introduced that try to support the alignment between business goals and technical operations which try to support said goals.

##  From IT management to information management
### 6 Stages after Nolan (70s)

1. Initiation: batch processing to allow cost reduction, no strategic interest
2. Contagion: Others want it too now
3. Control: Management gets concerned about costs wants to see ROI
4. Integration: Integtation of applications
5. Data Administration: Information requirements are key driver now. People start understanding value of information
6. Maturity: IS/IT Planning is key-task now, closely linked to business development

### 4 Eras after Rockart

1. Accounting Era: Batch processing, mainly information systems driven
2. Operational Era: Transactions with continual updates of data, little line operational management involvement
3. Information Era: Use information for individual decision support
4. Wired Society: Communication, collaboration, IS provide technology, boundry spanning, integrated systems, strategic importance

### 5 Phases after Seibt

From the 60s till today: 

Programming Mgmt -> Data Center Mgmt -> Life Cycle Mgmt -> **Mgmt of Information and Knowledge, IS/IT as multiplicator**

## Frameworks for information management

### Three layer model of IM after Wollnik (1988)

Not the three layers of IS systems but rather one step back (zoomed out):

1. Layer of ICT (Hardware)
2. Layer of IS
3. Layer of information usage and employment

### Integrated IM after Herget (2004)

Information management is becoming more popular, but the term is overloaded or bloated. *Information Systems* focuses on the use of information technology, so the technical side. The model tries to integrate both technical digital aspects as well as human factors such as hardcopies and knowledge in people's minds.

#### Integrated IM: The organization's objectives

IM needs to be placed at the topmost level of management. An Information strategy needs to be formulated. What is the **goal of the firm**? This defines requirements for the capabilities. However also the capabilites can influence the strategy, by introducing new opportunties through emerging technologies.

#### Integrated IM: Information capabilities

What **should be available** to fulfill the goals formulated in the strategy? Information can be internal or external, the **information architecture** gives an overview of the information types available.

#### Integrated IM: Information systems and services

Describes the systems and services that can be seen as information resources, supplying information to entities.

#### Integrated IM: Infrastructure

The entire stack of software, hardware, personell that enables the layers above (IS which serve capabilities which enable goals to be reached)

#### Integrated IM: Information behavior

* Stimulation of effective exchange and usage of information, emphasizing importance of information
* All levels need to be stimulated to keep focus on information as key ressource

#### Integrated IM: Information controlling

Information controlling ensures use of activities is larger than cost. All activities must be regularly verified and adapted.

##Aligning business with management of information and IS/IT

### Strategic Planning and Duality of IT

The duality of IT means the situation that IT doesn't only serve as a support to goals but it also enables organisations to pursue new paths and markets (b). Also IT can disrupt entire industries (e) by allowing new products and services to substitute others or render others obsolete.

#### Trade off between exploitation and exploration

**An organization, such as a firm, a government or a political party has to choose how much of their resources to allocate to each of these activities.**

>The test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. (F. Scott Fitzgerald)


### Strategic Alignment

#### "Fit" in Information Systems Research

* How can IT contribute best to organizational productivity?
* explanation of productivity paradox: Not use of IT per se causes productivity gains but good *fit* of technical and business components
* requires **integrated planning** of ISM and Strategic Management. IT cannot be aquired and expected to deliver benefits without adapting business , goals and processes accordingly.

#### Strategic Alignment Model (SAM)

Including 4 domains that need to be aligned:

* Business strategy (external)
* IT strategy (external)
* Business structure and processes (internal)
* IT infrastructure and processes (internal)

Fit has to be achieved in two dimensions:

1. internal-external fit
2. business-IT fit

##### What are central concepts and ideas of the SAM framework?

The model for IT and business alignment is based on two building blocks: strategic fit and functional integration. These two building blocks can be seen as dimensions which in turn make four combinations possible:

- Business Strategy (External domain, business function)
- Organizational infrastructure and processes (internal domain, business domain)
- IT Strategy (external domain, IT domain)
- IS infrastructure and processes (internal domain, IT domain)
The different alignment perspectives then show different “paths” how one area of expertise influences the others.


##### Explain the four alignment perspectives and how they differ.

1. Strategy execution: A business strategy has been formulated. The organizational structure is then defined and the IS are set up to support this structure. Both the organization structure as well as the IS „serve“ the business strategy in order to succeed.
2. Technology Transformation: A business strategy has been formulated. However, the IT strategy is not constrained by the current organizational structure but instead can be freely formulated and designed to best serve the pure business goals independent of current business structures.
3. Competitive potential: Managers explore how IT and new technologies might enable new or enhanced business strategies. Therefore, the technology significantly influences the business strategy. The organizational structure is adapted after the business strategy has been changed or improved.
4. Service level: The IT strategy is separated from the business strategy. The main goal is enabling a firm to become a world class IS service organization.

##### How can the SAM framework contribute to, for example, strategic planning, and how can it be criticized?

Managers can use the framework as a guideline to evaluate effects of new technologies. E.g. the second perspective can be used to continuously evaluate new technologies and there possible implications for the firms organizational structure.
The framework can be criticized for its complexity and ambiguity. If one was a bit cynical, its basic recommendation could be summarized to be that a companies management needs to watch both the business environment as well as the technological environment and adapts its firm accordingly. The four perspectives only describe whether a firm thinks “business first” or “technology first”.
