### Introduction into Big Data

##### Data Warehouse and Data Mart

An organization usually tries to only have one warehouse but can have several marts. Both have reporting and query functions and are optimised for such activities, however marts are much smaller and only include a fraction of the overall data.

##### Data-Mining 

* mainly explorative analysis of large strctured datasets
* looking for clusters, patterns, ...

### George G Haas Big Data and Management in Academy of Management Journal

Intended to serve as a kick off to cause more papers researching the management perspectives on Big Data and BI technologies and their consequences.

* Sensors serve as high quality high precision structured data input
* unstructured data (text, websites, video, audio) is of growing importance
* typical statistical tools unfit for big data analysis, due to larger data-sets. 
    - Outliers also of high importance
* not only correlation interesting but ultimately causation and conclusions are goal

### Sources of Big Data

* Public Data
    - from governmental organizations or other public institutions
* Data exhaust
    - data generated as a side-effect of other activities (e.g. cell tower login/logouts)
* Community Data
    - data generated by community activities from several actors that generate publicly visible data
* Self-quantification data

#### BI&A Stages by Chen

1. BI&A 1.0: structured content, relational data
2. BI&A 2.0: unstructured data, web crawling, natural language questions, content analysis
3. BI&A 3.0: Mobile & sensor data, structured and real-world information, increasing level of detail

#### Technology differentiation by Chen

* (big) data analytics
* Text analytics
* web analytics
* network analytics
* mobile analytics

### Use Cases of Big Data (Analytics) 

#### Data-Driven Decision making

* Overall tendency to be more productive
* requires ability to question oneself, accept data driven, non intuitive results
* danger for biased queries which in their structure lead to verification of hypothesis


### Challenges of Big Data (Analytics)
