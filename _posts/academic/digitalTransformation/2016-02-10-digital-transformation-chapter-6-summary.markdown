## Sourcing-Decision

### Reasons for IT-Outsourcing

##### Costs

* fixed to variable costs
* Improved **cost transparency**
* rising cost awareness

##### Personnel

* prevention of **HR aquisition issues**
* Relieving internal IT from routine tasks
* reducing firms dependence on individual specialists → *only works if internal IT is not supposed to now only perform specialists tasks*

##### Risk

* reducing risk from the increasing **complexity** of technology
* Possible increase of **data security**
* **contracts** transfer risks towards service providers

##### Concentration

* Focus on **business-core**
* Outsourcing of simple and **routine tasks** → use economies of scale for low-risk activities

##### Financials

* avoiding **high investments**
* possitive effects on annual **financial statement**

##### Technology

* access specific know-how from service provider
* use of latest tech without fixed investments

### Risks and reasons against IT Outsourcing

##### Costs

* One-Time **switching costs**
* lock-in / dependency of service provider lead to **loss of control**
* increased **coordination, communication and controlling costs**

##### Personnel

* loss of **key-personnel** and their know-how
* negative impact on motivation for remaining personnel which only serves a controlling and coordinating role

#### Reasons against Outsourcing in practice

* Dependence on other companies

## “Make and Buy”?

#### Transactional cost theory

* Economic transactions are associated with costs.
* Different coordination forms (market, hierarchy, hybrid) have different transaction costs.

#### Why IT cannot be compared to other ressources in the outsourcing discussion

IT is a strategic *enabler*, serving as innvation and inspiration hotspot for business transformations. If IT is outsourced, vision for IT as rising core competency might be lost (→ GM example)

#### Complementary effects of Outsourcing and internal IT investments

* Freed IT personnel resources can be used for strategic tasks (e.g. Business-Alignment)
