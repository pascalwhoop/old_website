## Information as a resource

### Development of the IRM perspective

#### History of IRM perspective

* US government started to realize burden of paperwork during 70s. 80s: **Paperwork reduction act**: Official overseas agencies use of information, ensures adequate usage, spread and storage of information
* Information (Resource) Management and IT Management merged to form one discipline: **I(R)M**
    - Data Management
    - Information Technology Management
    - Strategic planning of information systems
* **Information Management is the management of information technology, systems, information and communcations technologies as well as comprehensive management tasks**. 

An information resource is a source of information that is reusable and must have a mechanism of access. Also various legal, organizational and economic conditions must be adressed. This takes time and effort. 

#### 4 Perspectives on Information

1. Information as a Production Factor: Operational activities require and produce information, each step of a value creating chain is both a source and a consumer of information. 
2. Information as Element of Coordination in Divided Labor: Tasks are divided among processors to enable achievement of complex goals. To coordinate and synchronize, information must be exchanged. 
3. Information as economic good: I can be traded, satisfies human needs and is actually available to demanders. Precisely, information itself isn't scarce, but the processing power to find the valuable pieces of information is a limited ressource. 
4. Information as Foundation for Competition: Information is asymmetrically distributed. Competitive advantages results in the ability to make use of the information available to oneself in a more effective way than others do.


#### Organisations as Information Processors

|| industrial society | post-industrial society | 
|:---|:----|:---|
| division of labor | divide work for efficient production | divide for efficient decision making and construct mechanisms for remaining communication |
|output|goods|services|
|perspective on organisation|assembly line of materials|information processing and decision system|

#### Economics of information and digital goods

##### Properties of information as economic good

* **Public-good-similarities**: appropriating returns on investment is difficult
* **Experience good**: Each piece has to be different or it will not be purchased twice by the same individual
* **reproduction and distribution**: is instant, no stocks required, all copies equal, economies of scale for resale
* **value**: either increases when shared or loses value when shared (depending on nature of information)

##### Economic problems due to imperfect information and IM solutions

||Scarcity|Selection|Moral Hazard|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Problem|Levels of preference not all known, who gets it?|Resources have different **characteristics**, not all known. Which one?|Behavior of contracted entities is not foreseeable, how to ensure benevolent behavior?|
|Solutions from (information) economics|price mechanism|First: self-selection, second: verification(obtain more information)|incentives for desirable behavior, penalties for bad|

### Strategy and competitive advantage

#### What is strategy

Several definitions exist, no clear "right" one:

* **Porter**: deliberately choosing a different set of activities to deliver a unique mix of value → **Competitive Strategy**
* **Henry Mintzberg**: Strategy emerges over time as intentions collide with and accomodate a changing reality. The result is the *realized strategy*

#### Market-based-view

Result of Porters' "Strategic positioning school of strategy". Also called Harvard School or Outside-in perspective

**→ Select the right 'position' in an 'attractive' industry. Find the strategic 'fit'**

##### Porter's five Forces Model

It divides entities in the competitive market into 5 groups:

![5 forces model](/images/2016-02-10-digital-transformation-chapter-2-summary/Elements_of_Industry_Structure.svg)

>Source: Wikipedia (2016)
{:.img-caption}

* **New Entrants**: New firms that may enter the market as competitors
* **Bargaining power of buyers**: the ability of buyers to user their market power to decrease a competitive position
* **Bargaining power of suppliers**: The ability of suppliers to use their market power to decrease  a competitive position
* **Threat of Substitues**: Other products that can replace the firm's offerings
* **Industry Rivalry**: current competitors for same of similar product

Based on these five forces a given industry is unattractive when all or too many factors of the five forces model are of negative effect. On the other hand an industry is attractive, if most factors are 

**Strategic reactions to the five forces**

1. Positioning:
2. Influencing the balance of the forces
3. Anticipating shifts: Analyse underlying factors and anticipate hoping for better reaction than the opponents

##### Porter's Generic competitive strategies

...Also: 

* Growth
* Alliances
* Time

#### Resource-based-view

Result of Penrose, Barney, Dierickx & Cool. Also called Inside-out perspective, Chicago school

**→ Develop and exploit your unique capabilities.** Competitive advantage derives from **unique** and **inimitable resources** and **competencies**, which allow to achieve a superior customer benefit

To check wether a resource is valuable to the firm, it must meet the 

##### VRIN criteria

* valuable: adds positive value to firm
* rare: not all firms possess it in the way your firm does
* inimitable: other firms are at cost disadvantage if imitation is attempted
* non-substitutable

#### Comparison and integration

If one compares MBV and RBV, they seem to both imply the others criteria and rather just focus on different concepts. The MBV is focusing on mature markets, trying to improve the short to mid-term planning horizon. The RBV on the other hand has a strategic planning horizon and tries to focus on emerging markets that are very dynamic and innovative and require an offensive competition. 

##### Integrate MBV and RBV

The two can be integrated using the SWOT analysis concept. The MBV, being an outside-in perspective focuses on **opportunities and threats**, while the RBV focuses on the **strengths and weaknesses** of a firm. Therefore the SWOT analysis can integrate the two.

#### Knowledge-based view

This view emerged from the RBV, implying that information is the most important resource of an organization and must therefore be focused on. The argument for KBV is that most traditional resources (labor, supplies, technology) are not VRIN, since they are widely available. But combining all these requires knowledge, which cannot be bought through markets. 

*Of course this can be argued, since the labor market offers specialists who posses knowledge.*


### Competitive advantage through information and IT

#### Productivity paradox and Carr debate

Early empirical study found no or even negative correlation between IT investments and organizational success. Carr argues **IT is a commodity** not a VRIN resource that leads to competitive advantage. Instead, IT investments lead to improvement in productivity and through market pressure, consumers profit from IT investments (in form of lower prices), not the organization. Therefore IT is required to **stay competitive** and is a **necessity**.

Carr argues IT is non-VRIN, because it is readily available and, over time, will be adapted by all firms. He argues that in the past, IT was a possible source for competitive advantage but nowadays, all firms posses IT and therefore it must be handled like any other production factor, aiming for efficiency and economical procurement.

*I argue, IT is an evolving concept that describes any digital technology. There's no "in the past and now" difference, because there are always new technologies being invented. Some IT investments are commodities and should be handled efficiently, while others can lead to competitive advantage due to their novelty and innovational capability allowing companies to be disruptive and conquer new markets.*

#### Ward & Peppard

*They argue similar to my critique towards Carr*. IT can be both a factor for increased efficiency as well as an enabler for creating new business opportunities. It can also help to bind customers and suppliers to your firm based on proprietary integration and links. By investing into IT, a firm can also **raise the barriers for entry** and increase its market power by **creating an IT platform**, a rather novel approach based on the business model of platforms. 

#### Porter's five forces

Applying the IT opportunities to the five forces model, each of the forces can be compensated or reduced by using IT

* New entrants: Raise barriers through IT investments
* B Power of Buyers: understand customers requirements and their price limits through analysis to increase margin individually to every customer. Also customers can be locked in, reducing their bargaining power due to increased replacement costs.
* B Power of Suppliers: Exploit information availabilty and market concepts to reduce producer surplus and replace with better priced ones
* Substitute products: Again create replacement costs based on lock-in effects
* Industrial competitors: Using the RBV, entering emerging markets causes competition to be low and market growth rate to be highly positive.

#### Barriers to imitation

Piccoli, Feeny & Ives argue, that while IT can usually be replicated, the cost to doing so is sometimes way out of proportion. IT can be very complex, replication costly and not economical. IT can therefore serve as a barrier for protect the competitive advantage of a firm. These **barriers cause response lag** and/or **high costs**. 

#### Information orientation

Marchand, Kettinger & Rollins assessed firms success based on their **Information orientation**, which is constituted of the three sub-constructs IT practices, information management practices and information behaviors and values. 

Information Management includes the following with increasing level of maturity:

* Maintaining: Reusing information to avoid collecting the same again
* Processing
* Organizing
* Collecting
* Sensing: Detect information in the firms surroundings, reflect upon perceived (intuitive) and sensed (information based) differences.
