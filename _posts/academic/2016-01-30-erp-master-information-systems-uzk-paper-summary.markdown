## Themifstocleous & Irani (2002) Novel taxonomy for application integration

A very old paper describing the first steps of EAI. It tries to develop a common taxonomy to improve communication and prevent missunderstandings due to various wordings for equivalent topics and systems. It comes up with the three categories **Intra-Organisational AI**, **Hybrid AI** and **Inter-Organisational AI**. So basically, it split a continous scale with no clear segmentations into three segments.
