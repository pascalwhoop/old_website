### Themifstocleous & Irani (2002): Novel taxonomy for application integration

#### 1. Is the proposed taxonomy of the paper enough to classify systems in practice or do you see any problems? And do you have any points of criticism regarding the discussed taxonomy for AI?

* Some services and applications cannot be classified by the taxonomy:
    * E.g. Facebook due to its novelty --> The model should be updated in order to capture the changed conditions
* For some services and applications the classification is not unambiguous:
    * E.g. The classification of Windows Azure and Cloud Computing is uncertain depending on its usage
* Overall, the model is nowadays not unambiguously usable, however it is a simplified abstract of the reality which can be used to have common taxonomy

#### 2. Can the mentioned benefits of application integration (AI) be achieved by any company (depending its size/ structure/ culture)?

* In general, the given taxonomy of AI should give any company (independent of size, culture and structure) an overview about the different classifications of AI
* A Decision, whether to integrate AI in a company, is the responsibility of the company itself

#### 3. Would you rather use AI and thereby be able to employ different systems from different resellers or would you prefer to use one unified package of only one reseller (àno AI necessary)? Assess.,

* This depends on the company:
    * If the company’s IT has grown dynamically, then it could be better to use AI. Due to it being most likely an already heterogeneous landscape.
    * If there is no standard process / system for the company’s needs, it could be better use AI in order to achieve maximum usage of the systems
    * If only one reseller is used, the linkages between the systems are simplified. Therefore one supplier could be beneficial.

### Saraf et al. (2012): IS integration and knowledge sharing in multi-unit firms

#### 1. With respect to the assumptions and constraints for the size of surveyed enterprises: Do you think these results can be seen as universal or rather as matter of fact for a special period of growth of an enterprise? Would you expect different results for small enterprises or even Start-UPs?

* Constraints concerning the restriction to the High-Tech and Financial Sector are justified. The results should also be visible in other branches and industrial sectors.
* The exclusion of Start-UPs is justifiable because of the normally very small company size and the lack of cross business unit processes.
* The limit of 15 Million US-Dollar is slightly to high. Also small and medium-sized enterprises should recognize similar effects even if not in such a big dimension.

#### 2. The authors state that IS integration ultimately still yields an increase in cross-BU knowledge sharing, although redistributing the power of the different influences on it. With that in mind, do you think one should try to find ways to weaken the effect of the "IS Integration Winner's Curse" or find a way to deal with the consequences?

* In our opinion, it does not pay off to try to weaken the winner's curse, since the winner's curse is only a local decrease on an overall increase, which means that in total there is still an increase of knowledge sharing despite the winner's curse effect.
* Therefore it should be more viable to find ways to deal with the reduced increase of knowledge sharing by letting everybody know that knowledge sharing will not be at its maximum and in case that higher knowledge sharing is needed they should manually force it.

#### 3. It is possible to argue that the text is neglecting too much the participants of the process of IS integration and knowledge sharing? Can you explain or exemplify to what extent the participants can diminish or extent the effects of IS integration on knowledge sharing?

* Participants can influence the effects of IS integration on knowledge sharing immensely.
* On the one hand resistance/refusal to use IS for knowledge sharing as well as inability to use IS diminish the effects on IS integration on knowledge sharing.
* On the other hand the support and approval of the participants can accelerate and heavily influence the process of IS integration on knowledge sharing in a positive way.
* In order to maximize the effects of IS integration on knowledge sharing, the human aspect should also be carefully considered.

### Mueller et al. (2010): Understanding the Economic Potential of Service-Oriented Architecture

*All question weren’t discussed due to time issues.*

<!--#### 1. Do you think it is realistic that companies offer their services based on their SOA infrastructure to other companies?

#### 2. Do you think it is possible to achieve the same benefits as SOA by using technologies respecting modularization and standardization? 

#### 3. Do you think the coding scheme was too strict, since most found chains were unique?

#### 4. Do you think SOA will succeed in the future?
-->

### Busquets (2015) Discovery paths - exploring emergence and IT evolutionary design in cross-border M&As

#### 1. Is there a best practice approach to perform Fusions or even a standardized way to do so?

*translated and lightly revised* The text tells about standardized synergies which lead you to an efficient way to perform the fusion. Every fusion is different and differs due to several small factors. The firm in the text was prepared for the fusion, so the “try and error”-approach was not used. Rather than that ideas were defined and the best were critically discussed. The conclusion was that there is no standardized way of performing a fusion, because every fusion proceeds different. It is necessary to find an individual solution to every fusion.

### Bidan et al. (2012): An empirical study of IS architectures in French SMEs

#### 1. The sample data is from 2002. Do you think any of the presented architectures would be irrelevant if the survey would be repeated?

One expects that the percentage of siloed architecture decreases due to better possibilities for small firms to use ERP (more flexible solutions and lower prices)

#### 2. Is the sample size and the sample distribution sufficient to be representative?

Size and age of the companies had been taken into consideration and are qualified variables. The chance that diverse business sectors (e.g. finance and pharmaceutical) differ in their approaches have not been examined, thus can´t be excluded.

#### 3. The European Commission says Frances’ SMEs are representative for the EU. Do you see any reason why this might be put into question?

The differences between France and other European countries need to be better examined before the results can be adopted to other countries.

#### 4. The categories would likely remain the same while the share of partially-standardized and mixed architectures will increase. A further approach can focus on the investigation about the evolution of the companies that where presented in the study.

### Jain & Ramesh (2015): The roles of contextual elements in post-merger common platform development

#### 1. Do you think the given roles of the CPO team would be different or even cancelled in a M&A of smaller companies (smaller than 50.000 employees)?

* No, because there would be the same tasks to solve, but the team size would change
* But it is uninteresting for small companies to do M&A (companies with 100 or less employees)

#### 2. Do you have any criticism about the results (SCOR) or the contributions to practice?

* The SCOR-Model is only a small part of the results and development, so there are other contributions
* SCOR-Model is a reference model, it tries to determinate best practices for industries, it is used to describe the taxonomy internally

#### 3. Is the resulting framework dependent on a specific industry? 

* The case in the study is specific, because there were three attempts which failed to integrate that framework
* The framework can be used in industries, in which strong synergy effects exist
* But the environmental part mentioned in the study is different, because it depends on the industry

#### 4. Would you say the project could have also been successful without as much support from the TMT?

* The project failed 3 times without support from TMT, therefore has TMT an impact on the success of the project
* Problem in this case is: TMT can’t support every project, because TMT has limited amount of time

### Sasidharan et al. (2012): The Effects of Social Network Structure on Enterprise Systems Success

#### 1. The research was limited to a public university setting. Do you think the implications can be transferred to other situations? (Private, smaller or more distributed Organisation)

The implications can be transferred to other organizations with similar structures. This also applies to private companies. Smaller organizations are excluded. As a general rule, the in-degree and betweenness of the organization are a crucial factor. For more distributed organizations would it be necessary to create a similar research.

#### 2. What might be reasons for the high individual-level perceived information quality/task impact for the central individuals in centralized networks?

In centralized networks the individuals with low in-degree centrality have to get their information via the indiviuals with high in-degree centrality. Therefore all information from all kinds of sources has to pass the central individuals in a high frequency which improves the information quality / task impact for these centralized individuals even compared to individuals in a decentralized network.

#### 3. Is it possible to maximize knowledge sharing and thereby positively influ-ence implementation success, while at the same time trying to increase in-degree centrality of specific employees and promoting organizational unit-decentralization? Which of the two ways do you find more effective to max-imize the information exchange between employees and help them better cope with the new system?

* Indeed it is possible to positively influence implementation success of an ES, by following at the same time both strategies of knowledge sharing:
    * increasing the in-degree centrality of different employees
    * promoting organizational unit-decentralization
    * If the employees of a BU have, each of them a lot of connections --> a high in-degree centrality, there is no one holding a central position in the network, so the organizational unit decentralization is high and still each employee has a high in-degree centrality. We can´t doubtless say if one of these ways is better than the other. In this situation it would be more effective if we would combine both strategies of information exchange, because following only one of them would in each case lead to situations where the information exchange won´t be successful due to their dependence of several other factors like for example the workload.

### Sykes (2015): Support Structures & Impacts on Employee Outcomes

#### 1. Do you think that the benefits one can advantage from peer advice ties are different in different departments? 

For example, some departments may bear very big workload, do you think in this situation it is better for the staff to turn to the traditional support structures for help instead of the peer advice ties?

#### 2. A key measure (i.e. job stress) of the traditional support structures [TSS] is not unique. Do you see the complexity and variaty of the components as a weakness of the method, as the chosen indicator may not be right?

#### 3. As the text is saying that peer advice ties have a stronger effect on the employee outcomes than the TSS, do you think it is necessary for a company to invest more time and money on peer advice ties than the TSS, or even directly to ignore the implementation of TSS?

### Eden et al. (2014): Sustaining the Momentum: Archival Analysis of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems

#### 1. Do you think that the case study is unbiased in regard to its sources?

Additional papers were identified through ‘snow balling’ through papers that were already identified via a keyword search. Thus, the identified papers may be biased towards some topics.

#### 2. Do you think the underlying framework is a good approach to categorize the literature? Are there any other options to categorize them?

* As a first approach the framework is a good way to categorize the literature
* Framework only considers one dimension
* Typically: Consider more dimension e.g. size of organization

#### 3. Why do you think is there so little research on the retirement phase?

* ERP systems as a concept are relatively new (1990s)
    * Few ERP systems have been retired
    * Problems of finding companies allowing studies
* Retirement phase is deemed unimportant
    * More investment into procuring new systems
* Retirement possibly neglected in selection of keywords
    * Possibly weak point of the study

#### 4. In how far does this study contribute to the practical use? Are there any implications for practice?

* The Study is primary an information for research
* A lack of research can give content for future studies
* Missing studies in some studies can also be reasoned by missing practical problem, because of simplicity
* A lack of research also can show a risk because of missing informations about a process

### Morris & Venkatesh (2010): The Role of ERP System Implementation

#### 1. Are you surprised about the results gained from the study?

#### 2. Do you have any further recommendations about how the research model could be improved, in order to make the measurement even more precise?

#### 3. Do you think of other possible factors, which have not been mentionedand considered, which could have an impact on job satisfaction?

### Gattiker & Goodhue (2005): After ERP Implementation 

#### 1. In the paper, the research is only focused on individual local manufacturing plants and how they contribute to overall value generation. Is this sufficient or would it be better to extend the research model to include global costs and benefits?

Yes, of course a consideration of the global environment of the firm would be necessary in order to get a comprehensive view of the costs and benefits. However, the research done in this paper is intentionally focused on the local effects of interdependence and differentiation on the impacts of individual local manufacturing plants after ERP implementation. Research from a global perspective has already been done in other ERP literature.

#### 2. In the paper, the results suggest that interdependence of one plant to the other plants in a firm have significant impact on the local (plant) level overall benefits from ERP. Can you give some examples for typical characteristics of interdependence?

In order to prosper, organizations must resolve uncertainty. The amount and types of uncertainty vary from organization to organization and include:
    * stability of external environment,
    * predictability of core processes,
    * how tasks are subdivided,
    * level of interdependence among those subdivisions.
* The greater the interdependence that one subunit shares with another, the greater the need for them to share information. Therefore, highly integrated mechanisms such as ERP systems would be beneficial. However, it has to be considered, that the level of interdependence can be quite different for each subunit.

#### 3. In the paper, a relation between ERP customization and the effects of differentiation is assumed. How do those variables actually play a role according to the research results?

A direct relation between ERP customization and differentiation could not be supported by the research results, meaning that there is no socalled “moderator effect” of ERP customization on the negative effects of differentiation. However, ERP customization for itself have a positive effect on task efficiency, also known as a “main effect”.

### Kim & Mukhopadhyay (2011): Determining Optimal CRM Implementation Strategies

#### 1. The research model is focused on the first two periods of CRM implementation. Is it possible to extend it to n-periods?

It is possible to extend the model to n-periods by using the provided transition matrix (modelled Markov process) from the authors. However, solving the model with n periods with n ≥ 3 would involve numerical solutions, which is outside the scope of this paper.

#### 2. The text often describes loyal customers as price-insensitive. In times of a connected web and omnipresent price-comparisons, do you think loyal customers would really pay a higher price than they have to just to stay loyal?

Yes, I think so. But only if there are truly benefits provided by the shop. For example, there are a lot of Amazon customers who almost buy everything from Amazon, just because of the enhanced service. If the shop doesn’t provide special CRM-enhancements the customers won’t stay loyal and swap to a cheaper competitor.

#### 3. Is it even possible or reliable to calculate / predict diseconomies of scale for IT-Systems modules before implementing them?

It is difficult to calculate due to the fact that IT- Implementation costs are in general difficult to calculate. As the model is based on period 0 and assumes that no CRM Implementation was made before, you can’t estimate how economies of scale will be in period 1 (no experience). The model says that no simultaneous implementation should be made when there are diseconomies of scale but this should be seen in comparison to the value gained through a another CRM-module.

#### 4. The authors main contribution is "instead of viewing CRM technology as a single composite innovation, managers have to consider the interactive nature of different types of CRM technologies in order to implement a CRM system successful".
With respect to this aspect, do you think the developed model is
valuable for practical use?

The great benefit provided by the model is that CRM systems are not seen as a whole anymore but as separate components and technologies. The model relies much on assumptions and some important factors are missing, for example the factor „competition“. Moreover, empirical data isn‘t available yet. Therefore it is very difficult to employ the model in practical use. To sum up, one could state that the model is not suited for practical application in its current form.

### Rai et al. (2006): Digitally Enabled Supply Chain Integration Capabilities 

#### 1. The survey was only completed by members of the Council of Logistics Management, an association made to improve SCM-knowledge. So, the expected implementation & knowledge of SCM is high. Is this a representative group to make reliable conclusions for regular companies?

* The study can be seen as representative and relevant
    * But: Relevance depends on the company. What is a regular company?
    * Example: Cisco has huge benefits of an integrated SCM (e.g. Just-in-time delivery) --> not a traditional logistics company!
* Companies with a more insignificant role of SCM are also anxious for improvement
    * They profit from institutions with high SCM know how (e.g. Council of Logistics Management).
* But: study has a big bias!
    * Limited to Council of Logistics Management

#### 2. The authors mentioned, that they only received 110 combined responses. Can this study be considered as representative?

Whether a statistic is representative or not depends on the used method and can be calculated due to several, mathematical criteria. So this is interdependent from the absolute count of participants. Also it is not recommended to rely on the peer review of scientific journals. Admittedly it is very unlikely that better Journals release faulty cases but it could even happen here.

#### 3. Do all involved parties derive equal benefits in the supply chain?If not, how can it be guaranteed that non profiting parties although want to enable supply chain integration in their operations?

* Not all parties derive equal benefits from the supply chain integration
    * E.g.: Larger-size companies often derive more benefits than smaller-size ones
* It isn’t easy to convince companies that don’t see an advantage for their business to implement expensive SCM systems
* How can resistance be convinced?
    * Put pressure on small-size companies
    * To reward resistance for participating in the supply chain
    * Subsidies
    * Provide training

#### 4. Many advantages of an integrated IT infrastructure and integrated SCM processes are outlined by this study. Are there any disadvantages in integrating supply chain processes and IT infrastructure?

*This question wasn’t discussed due to time issues.*

Possible answer:
There are disadvantages or challenges like:
* Data security (sensitive data have to be transferred)
* A system which isn’t implemented properly can lead to a bad firm performance
* Implementing a fully integrated supply chain process is very expensive and needs a lot of time
