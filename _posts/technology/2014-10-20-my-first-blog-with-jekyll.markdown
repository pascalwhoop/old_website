Well actually it's my second one, the first one being an experiment from back in the days on blogspot or wordpress (I don't even remember)...

Anyhow, this was actually a recommendation by a colleague of mine,  [Stefan Glase](http://stefanglase.de). He told me about the hosting of your own blog using the github page system and jekyll to blog using markdown. Also I liked the idea of not using something like wordpress  (where I felt like I have less controll over what everything looks and feels like) but also not writing a new website from scratch. With jekyll I have a good balance of the nerdishness I like to have + I can create new content fairly easily, by just writing a markdown document and pushing it to Github. I'm curious about what's to come next.
